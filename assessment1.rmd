#RMarkdown editing 

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for **data science**. You can use a single R Markdown file to both *save* and *execute* code and to generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.
R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats.
